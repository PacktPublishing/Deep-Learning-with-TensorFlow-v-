# Deep Learning with TensorFlow [Video]
This is the code repository for [Deep Learning with TensorFlow]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-tensorflow-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
With deep learning going mainstream for making sense of data, getting accurate results using deep networks is possible. This video is your guide to explore possibilities with deep learning—it will enable you to understand data like never before. With efficiency and simplicity of TensorFlow, you will be able to process your data and gain insights which would change how you look at data.

With this video, you will dig your teeth deeper into the hidden layers of abstraction using raw data. This video will offer you various complex algorithms for deep learning and various examples that use these deep neural networks. You will also learn how to train your machine to craft new features to make sense of deeper layers of data. During the video course, you will come across topics like logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, training deep networks, and so on. With the help of practical examples, the video will cover advanced multilayer networks, image recognition, and beyond.
